            <p class="subhead">Analyzing over a century of deaths on Everest to understand who dies, when, where, and why</p>

</div>

        <p>Men have a higher risk of dying on Mount Everest, according to a century of expedition data from the Himalayan 
            Database.</p>
        <p>The database shows that fatalities among men, both climbers and Sherpas, have remained consistently higher throughout 
            the recorded history of Everest expeditions. The analysis includes data from 1921 through the Winter 
            2024 climbing season.</p>
        
        <p> The Himalayan Database is a comprehensive record of mountaineering expeditions in the Nepal Himalaya. 
            It was originally compiled by Elizabeth Hawley, a longtime Kathmandu-based journalist who began documenting 
            climbs in the 1960s. After her retirement in 2016, a nonprofit organization took over management of the database. 
            She died in 2018. The records include expedition details, climber demographics, summit outcomes, and fatality causes.
</p>
        <p>Expeditions in the early 1920s had the highest death rates on record. In 1921, 1922, and 1924, a total of 96 men 
            attempted to summit Everest. One in four died during those attempts. These early years are marked as an outlier, 
            but elevated death rates continued through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.</p>

<p>The first recorded female fatalities occurred in 1979. Since then, the fatality rate for women has remained lower than for men. 
    In the 1970s, the death rate for male climbers peaked at around 5 percent. For women, the fatality rate reached 2.33 percent, 
    the highest ever recorded for female climbers. But that number came from just one death out of 28 summit attempts. 
    The percentage appears high only because so few women were on the mountain that decade, and it does not reflect an unusually 
    high risk for women during that period. That decade also marked a historic milestone. 
    In 1975, Junko Tabei of Japan became the first woman to summit Mount Everest.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the death rate for women remained around 1 percent. For men, it was closer to 2 percent. 
    Women have consistently had a lower fatality rate than men over the past 25 years. 
    Their rate has been almost half that of men for each decade.</p>
<p>A 2023 scoping review by the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) supports this trend. 
    The report, titled Frostbite and Mortality in Mountaineering Women, found that men consistently face higher mortality on 
    peaks such as Everest and Aconcagua, even when accounting for the lower number of female climbers.</p>

<iframe title="Mount Everest Has Claimed More Than 350 Lives in the Past Century" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-amYvu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/amYvu/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="694" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}})}();
</script>
        
<p>The UIAA noted that most deaths on high-altitude, non-technical peaks are caused by altitude-related illness—such as 
    high-altitude pulmonary edema or sudden cardiac events. These conditions are reported more frequently in men.
    The UIAA Medical Commission did not cite a clear biological explanation. However, it suggested that behavioral, 
    social, and cultural factors may contribute. Women may be more likely to climb in teams, avoid solo expeditions, 
    choose less risky conditions, or turn around earlier when conditions worsen. 
    The report emphasized that these remain hypotheses, not proven causes.</p>
<p>A separate 2020 study that examined Everest expeditions from 1990 to 2019 found similar death rates between men and women. 
    However, that study only included expedition “members,” or climbers listed on official summit permits, and excluded Sherpas
    and high-altitude porters. Most of these workers are male, and their risk is significantly higher due to repeated exposure 
    and occupational demands. </p> 
    <p>In contrast, this analysis includes all recorded deaths on Everest, including Sherpas.
        That broader scope reveals that male fatalities are substantially higher. Among expedition members, 224 men and 13 women 
        have died. Among Sherpas, 115 men and one woman have died.</p>
<p>The only woman from the Sherpa community who died on Everest is Pasang Lhamu Sherpa. She became the first Nepali woman to 
    summit Everest on April 22, 1993. She died the following day during her descent, at an altitude of 8,750 meters.
    Pasang Lhamu was the leader of a government-sponsored Nepali women’s expedition. Her death occurred almost exactly 40 years 
    after the first confirmed ascent of Everest in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.</p>

<p>According to the Himalayan database, the first recorded Everest fatality was Alexander Mitchell Kellas, a 52-year-old climber 
    from the United Kingdom. He died on June 5, 1921, of heart failure at 5,700 meters, during the approach march near Kampa Dzong.
    As of the end of the 2024 climbing season, the most recent fatality was Joshua Cheruiyot Kirui from Kenya. 
    He died on May 22, 2024, at 8,800 meters, just 100 meters below the summit. The cause was Acute Mountain Sickness, 
    the second most common cause of death among climbers after falling, according to the Himalayan database.</p>
<p>The oldest person to die on Everest was Min Bahadur Sherchan, 85, of Nepal. He died on May 22, 2024, at 5,350 meters. 
    According to the BBC, he was a former Gurkha soldier attempting to reclaim the record for the oldest Everest climber 
    from Yuichiro Miura of Japan, who summited at age 80 in 2013. Miura had previously broken Sherchan’s own record set in 2008, 
    when he summited at 76.</p>
<p>One of the youngest was Pemba Sherpa, a 19-year-old cook who died at Base Camp during the 2015 earthquake-triggered avalanche. 
    He was from Solukhumbu, the district where Everest is located.</p>

<h2 class="subhead">Causes of Death</h2>
        
        <p>From 1921 to 2024, there have been 353 recorded deaths on Mount Everest. The leading causes are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Avalanche: 85 deaths</li>
            <li>Fall: 76 deaths</li>
            <li>Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS): 50 deaths</li>
            <li>Illness (non-AMS): 30 deaths</li>
            <li>Exhaustion: 30 deaths</li>
            <li>Exposure/Frostbite: 27 deaths</li>
            <li>Icefall Collapse: 19 deaths</li>
            <li>Disappearance: 14 deaths</li>
            <li>Crevasse: 10 deaths</li>
            <li>Falling Rock or Ice: 5 deaths</li>
            <li>Other/Unknown: 7 deaths</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Avalanche is the most frequent cause, responsible for about one-quarter of all fatalities. 
            Major avalanche events occurred in 1996, 2014, and 2015. In 2014, 16 Nepali guides were killed. In 2015, 
            an avalanche triggered by a massive earthquake claimed 14 lives at Base Camp.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/24466784"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24466784/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="scatter visualization" /></noscript></div>
        
<p>Nearly two-thirds of avalanche victims were Sherpas, reflecting the nature of their high-risk responsibilities.</p>
<p>Falling is the second most common cause. Three out of every four fall-related deaths involved climbers rather than Sherpas, 
    pointing to a different type of risk. Climbers are most vulnerable during summit pushes and descents, while Sherpas face 
    risk earlier in the season, often while fixing routes.</p>
<p>Acute Mountain Sickness is the third most common cause. It affects climbers disproportionately compared to Sherpas, 
    who typically have more experience at high altitudes and greater physiological adaptation.

</script>
<p>The timing of fatal incidents reveals a sharp divide in risk based on role.</p>
<p>About 40 percent of all Everest deaths occurred during the route preparation phase. Of the 134 deaths in this stage, 
    96 were Sherpas. Route preparation is largely the responsibility of Sherpa guides, who often face dangerous icefalls, 
    crevasses, and avalanches weeks before summit attempts begin.</p>
<p>In contrast, the descent phase is the second-deadliest period, with 125 recorded deaths. 
    Of those, nearly 90 percent were climbers. The descent is often when climbers are most exhausted, have depleted oxygen, 
    and are exposed to worsening weather conditions.</p>

    <h2 class="subhead">Countries Most Affected</h2>    
        
<p>Nepal accounts for the largest number of deaths on Everest. More than 40 percent of all fatalities were Nepali, 
    primarily Sherpas and high-altitude workers.</p>
<p>Other countries with significant numbers of fatalities include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>India: 29 deaths</li>
            <li>United Kingdom: 22</li>
            <li>United States: 17</li>
            <li>China: 12</li>
            <li>Russia: 9</li>
            <li>Australia: 9</li>
            
        </ul>
        
    <p>As of the Autumn–Winter 2024 season, a total of 353 people have died on Mount Everest. 
        The data highlights persistent patterns in who dies, when, and why.</p>
