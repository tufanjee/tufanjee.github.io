# Journalists and Media Workers in Political Violence Across South Asia

This is the analysis of data on political violence and demonstrations involving journalists and media workers in South Asia as part of Columbia University's LEDE 2025 course. The dataset, titled 'Disorder Involving the Media,' contains records of political violence and demonstrations involving journalists and media workers, downloaded from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project [(ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/curated-data-files/#media)

ACLED [codes](https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ACLED_FAQs_-ACLED%E2%80%99s-Journalists-Associate-Actor_4.2020_Final.pdf) any event involving media workers under the 'Journalists' associated actor category. This includes cases where media workers are specifically targeted as well as events where media workers are part of a larger group of civilian victims. ACLED defines journalists or media workers as "all civilians who engage professionally in the creation of news media."

The original [dataset](https://acleddata.com/curated-data-files/#journalists_Jul04) covers 149 countries and territories across Africa, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Southeastern and Eastern Europe and the Balkans, the Caucasus and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. However, this analysis focuses specifically on the South Asian region. After downloading the complete dataset, I filtered the data to include only the 'South Asia' region. While ACLED has data [dating back to January 2010](https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2019/01/ACLED_Country-and-Time-Period-coverage_updatedFeb2022.pdf), I used January 2020 as the starting point because ACLED began collecting data for the Maldives only from early 2020. This ensures a consistent timeframe across all countries in the analysis.

Of the eight South Asian countries, Afghanistan and Bhutan are not included in this analysis due to a lack of available data in ACLED for these countries. The dataset is updated weekly, typically every Monday or Tuesday. This dataset was downloaded on July 8, 2025, and covers events through July 4, 2025.
